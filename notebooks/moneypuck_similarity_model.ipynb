        "My dad and I have followed hockey closely but in different eras. My dad closely followed the NHL in the mid-2000s to mid-2010s while I've followed the sport since 2010 until now. Recently, we've been following our local San Jose Sharks since there seems to be a new [golden goose](https://www.nhl.com/sharks/player/macklin-celebrini-8484801) playing there and resurecting that franchise into relevance.\n",
        "\n",
        "To catch him up to the sport, I often times find myself making comparisons of today's players to players in the 2010s that we both knew. For an offensive defensman like Cale Makar, I would say something like \"he plays like Dan Boyle with better skating\" or for Auston Matthews \"he shoots it like Ovechkin\".\n",
        "\n",
        "With that context, I wondered if I am able to build a unsupervised model that evaluates similar players from different seasons and eras. If only there were a way to find this year's version of 2008 Alex Ovechkin..."

This exercise has little to do with coming up with features and rather just using them, so if you want to have a look at what each stat means, [here's a download to a glossary that explains them](https://peter-tanner.com/moneypuck/downloads/MoneyPuck_Shot_Data_Dictionary.csv).\n",
